4 Jan 2023.
In the process of tuning the PSK modes.
All 4 are working well, sensitive as expected.
300 sym/sec modes take too long to lock on to
offset carriers.

- 600 QPSK is now retuned, it's very good. Fast and sensitive.

I'm going to retune 300 BPSK again next.

- 300 BPSK is now retuned. Also very good.

- I tried retuning 1200 BPSK but the improvements were slightly worse.
- Reverted 1200 BSPK to last tune. It's very good.


This is a good checkpoint to return to.
