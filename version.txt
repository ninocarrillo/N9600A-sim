4 Jan 2023.
In the process of tuning the PSK modes.
All 4 are working well, sensitive as expected.
300 sym/sec modes take too long to lock on to
offset carriers.

- 600 QPSK is now retuned, it's very good. Fast and sensitive.

I'm going to retune 300 BPSK again next.

- 300 BPSK is now retuned. Also very good.

- I tried retuning 1200 BPSK but the improvements were slightly worse.
- Reverted 1200 BSPK to last tune. It's very good.

Next is one more check on QPSK 2400.
The offset response time is too long (up to 10 packets)!
Lowering max offset to 25Hz for this mode.


This is a good checkpoint to return to.
