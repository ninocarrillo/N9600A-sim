1111 300 Baud AFSK AX.25 (compatible with HF APRS)
1110 300 Baud AFSK IL2P (I believe Direwolf already supports this)
1101 300 Baud AFSK IL2P with rate 1/2 convolution and Viterbi detection (about 150 bps)
1100 150 Baud AFSK with increased Reed Solomon FEC, block interleaving, and rate 1/2 convolution (about 40 bps)

Improve SSB AFSK demodulator performance in detuned situations
- Add multiple demodulator streams - This worked. Two demodulators spaced 10 Hz above and below center (without a center demod) gives better performance than a single demodulator at center for both tuned and detuned scenarios
- Investigate correlator pattern modifications to widen tone detection bandwidth-- *** Did not work. Tried sweeping the correlator frequency and it made everything worse."
